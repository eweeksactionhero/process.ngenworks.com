==================
Discovery Proposal
==================

Here's an example proposal for Separate Discoveries. We take this route when a project looks very complex (as in, lot of moving parts), or has a lot of unknowns. The result of this approach is a well-detailed scope, duration, and price for the full-on project.

    Hello Alex, Lindsey, and Steve.

    Here’s the plan for the Discovery process that we recommend doing prior to moving forward with this project.         While we know your goal is to make selling and buying easier and even more fun for your users, there might be        some hurdles to accomplishing this. Hence, the Discovery process!

    **The Plan**

    We’ll research what it will take to create a usable, useful, and fun application for your users to buy and sell      their wares. This will help all of us understand the true nature and scope of the project as well as the cost.       This will include:

    * Researching payment options and understanding how your current payment process works.
    * Researching user experience issues and options related to mobile devices and transaction-based applications.
    * Talking to current users about their experience selling on your site (as well as selling on other sites/apps).
    * Investigating stats on device usage of your current users to best target your market.
    * Investigating pros and cons of developing for “native” device applications versus web-based applications. 

    Accomplishing this will take about 25 hours (give or take a few) and 10 business days. We probably won’t use all those days, but when we talk about engaging with users, we do it on their timelines and that can make things take a bit longer. As such, the 10 days usually gives us the time we need.

    **The Process**

    We'll want you in on the process as well. A kickoff meeting will take place once we agree to move forward wherein we’ll talk about what’s going to happen, the resources and access we’ll need, and what you can expect from us (and vice versa).

    **The Delivery**

    We’ll end the Discovery process by handing over a brief report of our findings as well as a meeting to go over the findings together. The report will offer a proposal on how to move forward and provide a solid estimate on cost for the full project.

    The report will act as a project guide for us if we all decide to move forward together.

    **The Price**

    A Discovery for applications such as this is $5000. Please feel free to contact us with any questions on the above, and we look forward to discussing things further at the kickoff meeting.

    The great thing about this approach is we’d have to do the Discovery work for the project anyway. This allows us to move forward truly understanding the scope and possible impact of the project.

    Let us know what questions you have!
